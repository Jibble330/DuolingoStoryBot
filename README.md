# DuolingoStoryBot

This bot uses Duolingo Stories to generate xp automatically. 
When first used, the bot will prompt you for a username and password. **This does not work with Google accounts.**
There is a work around to the *Google* account problem, which is to use the forgot password function when logging in, and changing your password.
This will update your account login to work with *Google* **and** regular login.

It will then login and go through every story that is not worth 0xp, and complete them, earning you xp.
